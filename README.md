# k8s-on-microk8s
This is a series of pods/deployments/etc. which could used on microk8s on ubuntu20 LTS for studying k8s better

## Welcome to the k8s on microk8s repository

**Background:**
I have a Ubuntu 20 LTS on my desktop / laptop and was using it to study k8s and play around. I had already tried k8s the hard way (kubeadm et al) and I had heard that microk8s on desktop was available. 
I decided to try it out. I used the classic microk8s v1.18.20  from Canonical installed using snap. For installation I followed the instructions at https://microk8s.io/
**Intent:**
Share the yamls with a larger community to play around with. Open for suggestions

**Action part**
Should you choose to use the yamls for your personal use, feel free to download/clone and please customize it for the locations, folders on your PC or laptop. 
The files are provided as-is with no liability on the author. The level of difficulty is easy to medium in terms of how comfortable the user is with k8s concepts.
